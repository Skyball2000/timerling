# Timerling

A simple countdown timer that works with multiple timezones.  
A version of this is hosted **[here](http://yanwittmann.de/projects/timerling/)**.

## News

- Version 2.1 has been released!  
  You can now store timers in a database by creating collections and adding timers to them.
- Version 2.0 has been released!  
  You can now have multiple timers at the same time and display them on a grouped view.

## Other stuff

A bit of context why I wanted to create this tool in the first place:  
After Mobius Digital Games announced their first and only DLC to the masterpiece that Outer Wilds is, I wanted to have a
countdown that shows the remaining time until the DLC drops. I even added an OW specific countdown method ;-)  
Then, something incredible happened: This project was featured by
**[Mobius Digital Games](https://twitter.com/Mobius_Games/status/1438230349641707523)**. Thanks so much to them!

Since I thought that this tool might be useful for a couple of other cases as well, I made it so that any countdown
could be created and shared with others.
